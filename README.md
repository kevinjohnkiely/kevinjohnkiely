### Hi there 👋 I am a full-stack web developer and recent graduate of Code Institute (Full Stack Software Development). 🇮🇪

Webmaster of my local soccer club [http](http://ballingarryafc.com/) since 2005 (Wordpress CMS based website)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on upgrading a portion of the above website to use a NodeJS, Express JS and MongoDB backend and React (with Typescript) frontend.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript, React hooks and side effects (useCallback etc), github & git commands and other bits n' pieces.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything within full stack web development over time, but for now focussing on front end (React).
- 🌱 On my "to-learn" list for the near future are: GraphQL, VueJS and possibly Java & Spring Boot.
